// Step 3:
// Setup Reducer for the store

/*
  What's a Reducer?
    It is a function that takes the current state and 
    an action that was dispatched as itâ€™s parameters and returns the new state.

*/

// Setting up postReducer so that
// we can combine this reducer with other reducers later 
// and make a big object for the store 
// reducer should mandatorily return a state.
// [Refer reducers/index.js] - for Step 4
const postReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  return state;
}
export default postReducer;
